# World_Weather_Analysis

The purpose of this weather analysis was to create a travel map for cities between the temperature of 90-105 degrees farenheit. Once all the cities were populated along with the hotel names, an itinerary was created with a travel map created that had the starting and ending point at Sindou followed by Kusti and Sakakah. When one pays attention to this itinerary, it will be noticed that middle eastern countries were chosen for this vacation search. Primarily due to the winter weather in the north at the moment. Once, this map was created, another marker map was created to let the traveller know about the details of the four destination they will be visiting in the middle east. This informaiton included country, city, hotel name, max temp along with current weather conditions at the destination of choice. Weather information within each city from the code that took input temperatures of 90 and 105 was saved on a CSV file along with another CSV files with hotel names on it.
